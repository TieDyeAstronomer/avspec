[^1]: In the context of amateur spectroscopy, "calibration" refers specifically to ***wavelength calibration***, the process of converting the x-axis of a spectrum from pixel number to wavelength. Other processing steps may be referred to with similar terms (*ex.*: [darks](darks.md) and [flats](flats.md) are also known as *'calibration frames'*), but the specific term "calibration" almost always refers to the topic described on this page.
