# Terminology

## "Normalization" vs. "Continuum rectification"?

Which term should we use when discussing the procedure of dividing a spectrum by its own continuum in order to flatten it?

### "Normalization"

- Less intimidating
- Easier to remember for most amateurs
- Is the term in broad use in the amateur community

### "Continuum rectification"

- Is used by at least a few professional astronomers (Q: how widespread?)
- Distinguishes from another procedure which is also sometimes referred to as "normalization" (the procedure of rescaling the entire y-axis without changing the shape of the spectrum)
