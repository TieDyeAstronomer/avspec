# Respect the data

# Leave analysis to the user

AVSpec collects data with specific, well-described processing steps applied. We do not accept spectra with any extra analysis steps applied (normalization, heliocentric correction, telluric removal, etc.), for multiple reasons:

- These steps are often uneccesary for research.
- With multiple methods available, and a lack of widespread adoption within the amateur community, consistency is difficult to enforce.
- The potential for error is high. Performing any of these steps incorrectly can lead to spectra which are invalid in subtle and hard to detect ways.

Leaving these optional steps up to the researchers using the data gives them complete control during their analysis, enhancing both accuracy and accountability.[^1]


[^1]: Of course, you can be a user of the data too--there's nothing to stop you from applying these advanced analyses to your own spectra, or to other spectra from the database! We merely ask that you do not include spectra altered in this way in your submissions.
