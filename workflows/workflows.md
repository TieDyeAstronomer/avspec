# WIP outline

Whereas the other documents for individual procedures will contain tutorials with the details on "how to do this procedure", these "workflow" documents should present a structural outline / overview of all the steps required & recommended for producing a spectrum.

These documents will be similar to checklists; a list of links to procedures, presented in the order that an observer should apply those procedures.

## Example workflow

### Slitless:

#### Prerequisites

- Select a [target]()
- Select a [standard star]()
- Record [darks]() (recommended)

#### In the field

- [Align the grating]()
- [Focus]()
- Photograph a spectrum (using [dithering]() if possible)
- Repeat step #3 with a standard star

#### Preprocessing

- [Stack]()
- [Apply darks]()

#### Reduction

- Create an [IR curve]()
- Profile (with [background subtraction]())
- Examine for [contaminants]() and snip any found
- [Calibrate]()
- Apply the [IR curve]()
