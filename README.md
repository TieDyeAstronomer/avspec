# About these files

This is a work-in-progress collection of documents which I have been writing to serve as educational materials for AVSpec. Feel free to look around, but keep in mind that all of this is still heavily under development, so there will be lots of blank or unfinished documents.

## Suggestions?
If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please let me know! I can be reached either via Slack (preferred), or via email at lherrington@aavso.org.
