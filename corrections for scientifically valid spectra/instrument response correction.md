# Instrument response correction (IR correction)

Everything that you can see, from the lenses and mirrors in your telescope to the air that we breathe, has a color. That means that when light shines through, some wavelengths are absorbed more than others, making even the best spectra naturally come out uneven. IR correction removes these irregularities, shaping the continuum of your spectrum to match a standard star.

## Why do IR correction?



## Which spectra need IR correction?

IR correction is encouraged but **not required** for spectra submitted to AVSpec.
