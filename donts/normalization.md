# *Don't:* Normalization

The term "normalization" can have multiple meanings.[^1] When we refer to normalization, here's what we mean:

> *Normalization*: the process of dividing a spectrum by its own continuum, so that the shape becomes flat and centered around y=1.

This process is also known as "continuum rectification".

# Why not?

Normalization changes the shape of the spectrum. There are multiple methods for describing the continuum, both parametric and manual

[^1]: Another definition of normalization, used sometimes in the research community, can be summed up as: *"changing the scale of the y-axis of the spectrum, **without** changing the shape."* Since this kind of normalization does not alter the shape of the spectrum, and the y-axis units are virtually always arbitrary anyway, spectra which are "normalized" in this simple way are perfectly acceptable for AVSpec.
