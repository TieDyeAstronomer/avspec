# To-do

## Framing / Context

- [ ] Review the existing spectroscopic manual, and identify where it can be used instead of new content
- [ ] Restructure this repository to best serve a user asking "How do I tell if this spectrum is good?"

## Writing content

I'll attack the task of writing in this order (**bold**==in progress)

- [ ] **[Dont's](donts)**
- [ ] **[Corrections for Scientifically Valid Spectra](corrections%20for%20scientifically%20valid%20spectra) (except for the tutorials)**
- [ ] [Types of aberrations](types%20of%20aberrations)
- [ ] Tutorials for the [Corrections for Scientifically Valid Spectra](corrections%20for%20scientifically%20valid%20spectra) section
- [ ] [Equipment tips](equipment%20tips)
- [ ] [Steps to capture a slitless spectrum](steps%20to%20capture%20a%20slitless%20spectrum)
- [ ] [Steps to capture a slit spectrum](steps%20to%20capture%20a%20slit%20spectrum)

## Graphics

- [ ] Graphics necessary for the written material (noted in the documents with "IMAGE:" placeholders)
- [ ] [Reference Spectra](reference%20spectra)

## Terminology which needs to be officially defined

I'll need to take these questions to the group to find out if there are strong opinions either way on which terms we should use for certain scientific procedures.

### "Normalization" vs. "Continuum rectification"?

Which term should we use when discussing the procedure of dividing a spectrum by its own continuum in order to flatten it?

#### "Normalization"

- Less intimidating
- Easier to remember for most amateurs
- Is the term in broad use in the amateur community

#### "Continuum rectification"

- Is used by at least a few professional astronomers (Q: how widespread?)
- Distinguishes from another procedure which is also sometimes referred to as "normalization" (the procedure of rescaling the entire y-axis without changing the shape of the spectrum)
