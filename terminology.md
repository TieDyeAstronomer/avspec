# Terminology which needs to be officially defined

I need input from the AVSpec working group to find out if there are strong opinions either way on which terms we should use throughout these documents.

## "Researcher" vs. "End user"?

Which term should we use to refer to a user of AVSpec's data?

### Researcher

>*"If features are missing, a researcher will have no way to know."*

- Reinforces the concept that if you submit spectra, they will be used for real science.

### End user

>*"If features are missing, the end user will have no way to know."*

- Reinforces the fact that anyone (including you!), can analyze data from AVSpec.

## "Normalization" vs. "Continuum rectification"?

Which term should we use when discussing the procedure of dividing a spectrum by its own continuum in order to flatten it?

### Normalization

>*"Normalization changes the shape of the spectrum."*

- Less intimidating
- Easier to remember for most amateurs
- Is the term in broad use in the amateur community

### Continuum rectification

>*"Continuum rectification changes the shape of the spectrum."*

- Is used by at least a few professional astronomers (does anyone know how widespread?)
- Distinguishes from another procedure which is also sometimes referred to as "normalization" (the procedure of rescaling the entire y-axis without changing the shape of the spectrum)
