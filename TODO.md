# To-do

## Writing content

I'll attack the task of writing in this order (**bold**==in progress)

- [ ] **[Dont's](donts)**
- [ ] **[Corrections for Scientifically Valid Spectra](corrections%20for%20scientifically%20valid%20spectra) (except for the tutorials)**
- [ ] [Types of aberrations](types%20of%20aberrations)
- [ ] Tutorials for the [Corrections for Scientifically Valid Spectra](corrections%20for%20scientifically%20valid%20spectra) section

After the above sections are complete, I will revisit the [Equipment tips](equipment%20tips), [Steps to capture a slitless spectrum](z_steps%20to%20capture%20a%20slitless%20spectrum), and [Steps to capture a slit spectrum](z_steps%20to%20capture%20a%20slit%20spectrum) sections, and re-evaluate whether these articles are necessary, or whether we can simply refer to content available elsewhere for these topics.[^2]

## Graphics

- [ ] Graphics necessary for the written material (noted in the documents with "IMAGE:" placeholders)
- [ ] [Reference Spectra](reference%20spectra)

## &#10003; . . . Framing / Context

- [x] Review the existing spectroscopic manual, and identify where it can be used instead of new content
- The *AAVSO Guide To Getting Started in Spectroscopy v3.1* already covers some of the topics in the [Equipment tips](equipment%20tips) section, and all of the topics in the [Steps to captures a slit spectrum](steps%20to%20capture%20a%20slit%20spectrum) section.[^1]
- The *AAVSO Guide To Getting Started in Spectroscopy v3.1* will need to be updated with the new AVSpec guidelines.
- [x] Restructure this repository to best serve a user asking "How do I tell if this spectrum is good?"
- A top-level document *"How to judge the quality of your spectrum"* may be a good idea once the [Identifying aberrations](identifying%20aberrations) section is more complete.
- Additional restructuring may be desirable once more of the content is complete.

[^1]: I've updated those files with notes about which sections of the Guide contain relevant info, and will avoid duplicating the content within the Guide. If I attempt to write AVSpec-specific content for those topics, it will only be after I've finished everything else in this repository.

[^2]: Some of the topics in each of those folders are already at least partially covered in the *AAVSO Guide To Getting Started in Spectroscopy v3.1*.
